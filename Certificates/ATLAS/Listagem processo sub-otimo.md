read entirety of handout of certification

listed topics from summary (wiki lpi) with wrights specifying summary/indexes pages, topics from handout summary(with pages from each one), and pages of exercises of each topic

after that created standards and compared contents of topics with requirements of standards, putting more content than less, copying summary naming from handout

from each topic listed used commands and summary content

added to end of file for standards contents related to each topic referenced from list of topics

created all primary notes referenced by standards

## next step: start to define topics to answer standards
info from standards files will be needed




check if all occurences of items are listed on topics!!!
