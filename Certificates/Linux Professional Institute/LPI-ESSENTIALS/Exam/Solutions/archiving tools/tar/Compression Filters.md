Some flags can be passed in a [[tar]] command, when used they act as compression filters

Some examples are:

| Long    | Short | Archive format                                                                                                             |
| ------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --gzip  | -z    | [[Certificates/Linux Professional Institute/LPI-ESSENTIALS/Exam/Solutions/archiving tools/compression tools/gzip\|gzip]]   |
| --bzip2 | -j    | [[Certificates/Linux Professional Institute/LPI-ESSENTIALS/Exam/Solutions/archiving tools/compression tools/bzip2\|bzip2]] |
| --xz    | -J    | [[Certificates/Linux Professional Institute/LPI-ESSENTIALS/Exam/Solutions/archiving tools/compression tools/xz/xz\|xz]]    |
| --zstd  |       | [[zstd]]                                                                                                                   |
