The term cloud computing refers to a standardized way of consuming computing resources, either by buying them from a public cloud provider or by running a private cloud. As of 2017 reports, Linux runs 90% of the public cloud workload. Every cloud provider, from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offers different forms of Linux. Even Microsoft offers Linux-based virtual machines in their Azure cloud today.

Linux is usually offered as part of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering. IaaS instances are virtual machines which are provisioned within minutes in the cloud. When starting an IaaS instance, an image is chosen which contains the data that is deployed to the new instance. Cloud providers offer various images containing ready to run installations of both popular Linux distributions as well as own versions of Linux. The cloud user chooses an image containing their preferred distribution and can access a cloud instance running this distribution shortly after. Most cloud providers add tools to their images to adjust the installation to a specific cloud instance. These tools can, for example, extend the file systems of the image to fit the actual hard disk of the virtual machine.

Linux in the Cloud

Another opportunity to become familiar with Linux is to deploy Linux within one of the many public clouds available. Creating an account with one of the many others cloud providers will allow you to quickly deploy many different Linux distributions quickly and easily.
