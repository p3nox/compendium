Linux is largely used in the tech industry to offer IaaS, PaaS and SaaS services. 
There are three main [[hypervisors]] which play an important role in supporting those: Xen, KVM and Virtualbox. 

Summary In this lesson you have learned: • Similarities and differences between free and open source software (FLOSS) • FLOSS licenses, their importance and problems • Copyleft vs. permissive licences • FLOSS business models

 • The server programs underlying many important Internet and local network services

Linux in the Cloud

Another opportunity to become familiar with Linux is to deploy Linux within one of the many public clouds available. Creating an account with one of the many others cloud providers will allow you to quickly deploy many different Linux distributions quickly and easily.

- Distributions
	- End-user
		- Desbian Based
			- Debian (Testing and Sid)
			- Ubuntu (Non-LTS)
	- Enterprise use
		- Debian Based
			- Debian
			- Ubuntu(LTS)
		- Redhat Family
			- Oracle
			- CentOS
			- Fedora
			- Scientific Linux
		- SUSE Family
			- openSUSE Tumbleweed
			- openSUSE LEAP


• Maintenance cycles, beta and stable
In this section you have learned how to differentiate between different operating systems
commonly available. We discussed:
• Linux Based Operating Systems
• UNIX
• macOS
• Windows Based Operation Systems
Within the Linux category we could further break the selection down into distributions with long
term support and those with a shorter support cycle. LTS versions being more suited to the
Enterprise and shorter term support being targeted toward home and hobby users.
• Enterprise Grade Linux Distributions
◦ Red Hat Enterprise Linux
◦ CentOS
◦ SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
◦ Debian GNU/Linux
◦ Ubuntu LTS
• Consumer Grade Linux Distributions
◦ Fedora
◦ Ubuntu non-LTS
◦ openSUSE
• Experimental and Hacker Linux Distributions
◦ Arch
◦ Gentoo
