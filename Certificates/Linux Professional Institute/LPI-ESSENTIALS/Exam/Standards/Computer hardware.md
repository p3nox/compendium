A system is the sum of its components. Different components impact cost, performance, and
usability in different ways. While there are common configurations for workstations and servers
there is no single best configuration.
- Motherboards, processors, power supplies, optical drives, peripherals
 • Hard drives, solid state disks and partitions, /dev/sd*

• Drivers
- device files

- Programs and configuration
• Processes
• Memory addresses
• System messaging

Likewise, we have explored hardware devices and learned the following:
• The /dev directory stores special files (aka nodes) for all connected hardware devices: block
devices or character devices. The former transfer data in blocks; the latter, one character at a
time.
• The [[dev|/dev]] directory also contains other special files such as [[-dev-zero|/dev/zero]], [[-dev-null|/dev/null]] or
[[-dev-urandom|/dev/urandom]].
• The /sys directory stores information about hardware devices arranged into categories.
Finally, we touched upon memory. We learned:
• A program runs when it is loaded into memory.
• What [[RAM]] (Random Access Memory) is.
• What [[Swap]] is.
In the context of data storage, the following topics have been discussed in this lesson: process
management and system logging and messaging.
Regarding process management, we have learned the following:


• [[How to display the use of memory]].


• The concept of system load average — which is very useful to check on CPU
utilization/overloading.

• ln -s
• ln

• Symbolic links
Where temporary files are stored.
• What is the special permission applied to them.
• What links are.
• The difference between symbolic and hard links.
• How to create links.
• How to move, rename or remove them.
