Topic 1: The Linux Community and a Career in Open Source
1-70


- What distributions does Linux have

- What are Linux embedded systems

- How are Linux embedded systems used

-  Different applicabilities of Android

-  Different uses of a Raspberry Pi

-  What is Cloud Computing

-  What role does Linux play in cloud computing




Summary In this lesson, you learned: • The package management systems used in major Linux distributions  • Common programming languages and their uses

The [[terminal]] is a powerful way to interact with the system and there are lots of useful and very mature tools to use in this kind of environment. 
You can get to the terminal by looking for a graphical one at your desktop environment menu or pressing Ctrl + Alt + F# . 

The browser is an essential piece of software in computing nowadays, but it’s necessary to understand some things to use it with safety. 
- DNT is just a way to tell the website that you do not want to be tracked, but there is no guarantee on that. 
- Private windows are private only to the computer you’re using but this can allow you to escape from cookie tracking exactly because of that. 
- [[TLS]] is able to encrypt your communication on the Internet, but you have to be able to recognize when it’s in use. 
- Using strong passwords is also very important to keep you safe, so the best idea is to delegate that responsibility to a password manager and allow the software to create random passwords to every site you log into. 
- Another way to secure your communication is to sign and encrypt your files folders and emails with [[GnuPG]]. 

[[dm-crypt]] and [[EncFS]] are two alternatives to encrypt whole disks or partitions that use respectively block and stack encryption methods. 
Finally, LibreOffice Impress is a very complete open source alternative to Microsoft Powerpoint
